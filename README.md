# Benchmarking AlphaFold3 for structure-based ligand discovery

This repository contains the code and workflow used in our paper, **“Benchmarking AlphaFold3 for structure-based ligand discovery.”**

# Overview

## DUDEz and LTS
The `DUDEz` and `LTS` folers contain example templates to run Alphafold3.

## Enrichment analysis
The `logAUC_calculation` folder contains pipeline to calculate enrichment metrics like logAUC.

## Structure Prediction on Out-of-Sample Data

The `out_of_sample` folder contains the workflow used to curate a dataset for structure prediction and then calculate relevant metrics.

## Perspective
The `perspective` folder contains example to run Boltz prediction and experimental data correlation calculation.
